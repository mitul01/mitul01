### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
<p> For some people data is just facts or numerical values. For me data is a puzzle. When looked at it correctly it never fails to tell something stunning. I love to work with data whether be it manipulation , analyzation or visualization.</p>

<p>My specialties include undying curiosity and constant handwork. After discovering my passion for Data Science , I gathered skills in data analytics and visualization , basics of statistical and mathematical inferences. Followed by Machine learning Algorithms. I have rigorously practiced my skills in various projects and hackathons.
Currently exploring the field of Deep learning. Have had keen interest in Computer Vision and Object Detection. </p>

<h2>Programming languages Experience :- C, C++ , Python </h2>
